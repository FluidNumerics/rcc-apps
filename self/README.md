[The Spectral Element Library in Fortran (SELF)](https://github.com/FluidNumerics/SELF) is a set of Fortran classes that can be used to construct PDE solvers using Discontinuous Galerkin, Continuous Galerkin, and Collocation Spectral Element Methods. This VM image includes serial-x86 and serial-x86+nvcc builds of the library to provide an environment to develop solvers in Fortran using spectral element methods.
