## Getting Started


## How to use this image
This image installs FEOTS via spack into the `/opt` directory by default. A view of packages is configured by default under `/opt/view` and the necessary `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are configured for you automatically so that necessary tools (e.g. `mpirun` and `feots`) are avaialable without additional configuration.
